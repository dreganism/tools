Iam trying to delete a directory in Linux using the rmdir command. However, I am getting an error message that read as follows:

rmdir: failed to remove 'trip-pictures': Directory not empty

How can I remove non empty directory in Linux using the cli?

There are two commands that one can use to delete non empty directories in Linux operating system:
1.  rmdir command – Delete directory only if it empty
2.  rm command – Delete directory and all files even if it is NOT empty

Procedure to remove non empty directory in Linux
The syntax is:

rm -rf dir-name
rm -rf /path/to/dir/name

Be careful when you use the rm command with -r and -f options. The -r option remove directories and their contents recursively including all files. The -f option to rm command ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt for anything. There is no undo option. So you have to be very careful with rm -rf command. Let us see some examples.
